    "text": "In this document, I’m going to show codes of simulation experiments and their results demonstrated in the short paper Introducing a General Framework for Locally Weighted Spatial Modelling Based on Density Regression. This paper mainly talks about a density-based local spatial modelling (DLSM) method, which was originally named as “geographically weighted density regression (GWDR)”. In the following parts, we don’t distinguish these two terms.\nIn addition to show reproducable code of experiments shown in the paper, We are going to describe a bit how to install and use this model."

    "title": "Introducing a General Framework for Locally Weighted Spatial Modelling Based on Density Regression",
    "section": "Three-dimensional Data",
    "text": "Three-dimensional Data\nIn most spatial modelling research, 3D data are usually referred to spatio-temporal data, i.e., data of geographical and temporal coordinates. For this type of data, there is a corresponding geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR, Huang, Wu, and Barry 2010) model. In this experiment, we compare DLSM model with this method.\n\nData\nWe created 4 sets of data through similar generation process introduced in the experiment on 2D data, named as data-3d-i where i is a value from 1 to 4. To access these data, please turn to GitHub worktree page.\n\n\nModel: DLSM\nThe DLSM model can be calibrated with the following codes:\n\nd3_gwdr_list <- map(c(1:4), function (i) {\n    d3_data <- readRDS(sprintf(\"compare-gtwr-%d\", i))\n    coords_range <- apply(d3_data$coord, 2, max) - apply(d3_data$coord, 2, min)\n    kernel <- gwdr.bandwidth.optimize(\n        formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x3,\n        data = d3_data$data,\n        coords = d3_data$coord,\n        kernel.list = list(\n            gwdr.make.kernel(coords_range[1] * 0.618, kernel = \"bisquare\", adaptive = FALSE),\n            gwdr.make.kernel(coords_range[2] * 0.618, kernel = \"bisquare\", adaptive = FALSE),\n            gwdr.make.kernel(coords_range[3] * 0.618, kernel = \"bisquare\", adaptive = FALSE)\n        )\n    )\n    gwdr(\n        formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x3,\n        data = d3_data$data,\n        coords = d3_data$coord,\n        kernel.list = kernel\n    )\n})\n\n\n\nModel: GTWR\nWe used the “GTWR ADDIN” for ArcMap (Huang and Wang 2020) to calibrate GTWR model for all the four data sets. This is because there is a key parameter \\(\\lambda\\) in GTWR mdoel which should be optimized according to data, just like the bandwidth. But gtwr() function in GWmodel package does not support this process. And this addin has much higher computing performance. Results are stored in the GTWR results folder. We can load them with the following codes.\n\nd3_gtwr <- map(c(1:4), ~ st_read(file.path(\"gtwr_results\", sprintf(\"compare-gtwr-%d-gtwr.shp\", .x))))\n\nReading layer `compare-gtwr-1-gtwr' from data source \n  `/Users/yigong/Documents/GIScience-Materials/posts/DLSM/gtwr_results/compare-gtwr-1-gtwr.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1000 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2672.301 ymin: 2695.423 xmax: 3369.969 ymax: 3310.724\nCRS:           NA\nReading layer `compare-gtwr-2-gtwr' from data source \n  `/Users/yigong/Documents/GIScience-Materials/posts/DLSM/gtwr_results/compare-gtwr-2-gtwr.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1000 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2672.301 ymin: 2695.423 xmax: 3369.969 ymax: 3310.724\nCRS:           NA\nReading layer `compare-gtwr-3-gtwr' from data source \n  `/Users/yigong/Documents/GIScience-Materials/posts/DLSM/gtwr_results/compare-gtwr-3-gtwr.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1000 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2672.301 ymin: 2695.423 xmax: 3369.969 ymax: 3310.724\nCRS:           NA\nReading layer `compare-gtwr-4-gtwr' from data source \n  `/Users/yigong/Documents/GIScience-Materials/posts/DLSM/gtwr_results/compare-gtwr-4-gtwr.shp' \n  using driver `ESRI Shapefile'\nSimple feature collection with 1000 features and 8 fields\nGeometry type: POINT\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: 2672.301 ymin: 2695.423 xmax: 3369.969 ymax: 3310.724\nCRS:           NA\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe analyse the performance of these two models based on coefficient estimates and actual values."
