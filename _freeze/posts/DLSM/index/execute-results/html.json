document, I'm going to show codes of simulation experiments and their results demonstrated in the short paper\n*Introducing a General Framework for Locally Weighted Spatial Modelling Based on Density Regression*.\nThis paper mainly talks about a density-based local spatial modelling (DLSM) method,\nwhich was originally named as \"geographically weighted density regression (GWDR)\".\nIn the following parts, we don't distinguish these two terms.\n\nIn addition to show reproducable code of experiments shown in the paper,\nWe are going to describe a bit how to install and use this model.\n\n# Installation\n\nThe R implementation of GWDR is in the unpublished [`feature-gctwr` branch](https://github.com/GWmodel-Lab/GWmodel2/tree/feature-gctwr)\nof package [**GWmodel**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GWmodel/index.html).\nTo use it, please clone this repositry, switch to this branch, and install this package manually.\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/GWmodel-Lab/GWmodel2.git GWmodel\ncd GWmodel\ngit switch feature-gctwr\nR CMD INSTALL GWmodel\n```\n\n::: {.callout-warning}\nPlease install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) if you are using Windows platforms.\n:::\n\nWhen all packages are ready, please go on to the next section.\n\n# Usage\n\nThe function `gwdr()` can calibrate a DLSM model according to given formula, data, and other settings.\n\n```r\ngwdr <- function(\n    formula, data,\n    coords, kernel.list, solver = \"kernel.smooth\", ...\n) { ... }\n```\n\nIt accepts several parameters.\nBesides the `formula` and `data` arguments that are constant with other regression models in R,\nthree additional key arguments are needed: \n\n`coords`\n: Coordinates to uniquely locate every sample.\nCoordinates may not only geographical positions, but also positions in other dimensions.\nFor example, coordinates of spatio-temporal data are geographical positions and the timestamp;\nand coordinates of flow data can consist of the geographical positions of origin points, flows' directions, and flows' length.\n\n`kernel.list`\n: A list of kernel settings for every dimension.\nEach item is a full specification of kernel function (including bandwidth) for a dimension, i.e., a column in `coords`.\nIt usually has three elements in each item: bandwidth value, kernel name, and adaptive or fixed.\nThere is a function `gwdr.make.kernel()` that would be helpful in creating elements in `kernel.list`.\n\n`solver`\n: The name of favored density estimation method.\nBy default, its `\"kernel.smooth\"` referring the kernel smooth estimation.\nThis estimation method is the same as ordinary GWR-family models, like basic GWR and GTWR.\nCurrently, there is another option `\"local.poly\"` for local polynomial estimation.\nThis method is better at eliminating boundary effects to produce more accurate estimates in the area near to boundaries.\nThe additional parameter `...` will be passed to the corresponding solver function.\n\nThe bandwidth values in `kernel.list` would significantly affect results.\nIf best values are unknow, there is a function `gwdr.bandwidth.optimize()` to obtain the optimized bandwidth values.\n\n```r\ngwdr.bandwidth.optimize <- function(\n    formula, data, coords, kernel.list,\n    optimize.method = gwdr.bandwidth.optimize.cv,\n    solver = \"kernel.smooth\", ...\n) { ... }\n```\n\nThe former four arguments and `solver` are the same as those in `gwdr()`.\nThe argument `optimize.method` is used to specify optimization criterion,\ni.e., Cross Validation (CV) or Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).\nThe former one is quicker while the latter one could avoid overfitting.\nNote that the underlying algorithm is the Nelder-Meed algorithm, which requires initial values of bandwidths.\nUsually, $0.618$ is good for adaptive bandwidths.\n\n# Experiments\n\nIn the following codes, the following packages are also required:\n\n- [**tidyverse**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyverse/index.html)\n- [**ggpmisc**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggpmisc/index.html)\n\nPlease install and load them too.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(GWmodel)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggpmisc)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe carried out three experiments, generating simulation data sets to demonstrate how DLSM works.\nWe also calibrated a corresponding GWR-family model in each experiment to provide a comparison.\nIn the experiments, based on the coefficient estimates we examine the proximity to their actual values\nby making scatter plot with regression lines and calculate their RMSE and MAE criterions defined by\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathrm{RMSE} &= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(r_1-e_i\\right)^2 \\\\\n\\mathrm{MAE} &= \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left|r_1-e_i\\right|\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere $n$ is the number of estimates, $e_i$ is the $i$-th estimate, and $r_i$ is the corresponding real value.\n\n## Two-dimensional Data\n\n### Data Generating\n\nData of two dimensions (equalivent to normal geographic data) are generated by the following codes.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngenerate_data_d2 <- function (size) {\n
